        <p>Growing up, I remember taking compuer classes starting in grade 5. I was naturally drawn to them and excelled in these classes. Come highschool I was literate in the basic knowledge of computers, this led me to taking my first coding classes. These were horrifically boring..</p> <br>
        <p>It wasn't until senior year, when I found treehouse and started to dabble in coding on my own. Some things caught my attention but mostly I would study code on and off. I even tried the tech degree trial when treehouse offered it and thought it was great, however I didnt have a job at the time and therefore couldnt afford the program. Fast forward a year, I stumble across the program again and decide to give it a shot and here we are now less than a week in.</p>
